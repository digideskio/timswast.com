This is the public source code for Tim Swast's personal [blog](http://www.timswast.com/blog).

The code is meant to be as simple as possible. Each "article" is meant
to be a stand-alone HTML page. This means that each article is independent.
This means that styles won't be updated to keep up with current trends, but it
also means that each article is a reflection of the time in which it was
written. By sticking to plain HTML, without a server-side component, I hope
that these articles will have the potential to be served in their original
form far into the future.
