My assignment for music theory was to create a composition with four-part harmony at least 16 measures long. My composition ended up being a bit longer than that, though. I thought it looked a little short, so I repeated the same phrase a few times. With some different dynamics, I don't think it will seem too repetitive though.

Feel free to download the score and use it where you see fit. I am distributing it under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States license so you can use it in any (noncommercial) way you want so long as you give me some credit. As my first real composition it may not be perfect, but it should sound at least OK. This has definitely been a learning experience.

Should you end up playing this or using in another piece, I would love it if
you let me know.
