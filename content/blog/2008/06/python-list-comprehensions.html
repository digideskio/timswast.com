    title: Python List Comprehensions are Easy!

I've know about list comprehensions for a while now, but I never really bothered learning how to use them. Today, I found that they really aren't that bad. In fact, if you already know how to populate a python list inside a for loop, you're 95% there already.

Say you wanted to populate a python list with 7, 7's. You might go about it by doing something like this:

    spam = []

    for x in range(7):
     spam.append(7)

With list comprehensions this becomes a one-liner:

    spam = [7 for x in range(7)]

Basically, you take your for loop and shove it inside the list declaration. Whatever you were appending goes first. Thus, if we wanted to change our list to be 7 powers of 7, you'd write:

    # this gives us [1, 7, 49, ...]
    spam = [7**x for x in range(7)]

Something as scary sounding as "list comprehension" really isn't anything more than shoving a for loop (or two) into where you declare the list. It's quite powerful, for being so simple.
