My name is Tim Swast. I am currently a junior at the University of
Wisconsinâ€”Madison, studying Computer Science with a certificate in
Mathematics. I have been coding for a rather long time, and I will continue
to do so for the foreseeable future.

Among my other interests is Amateur Radio (my callsign is KC9OOE). I especially
enjoy going out on the Badger Amateur Radio Society's biannual "foxhunts."
Other than that, I usually just hang out on two meters.
