I made this game while in middle school (2001-2002). Sadly the original Game
Maker file has been lost, but I was able to find an executable version for your
enjoyment.

Credit for the sound effects goes to Bryce Doty, and I owe an enormous debt
of gratitude to my brother, Jon, for game-play testing.
