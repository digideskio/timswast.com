 Neural networks are models of the brain. Actually, there are many different kinds of neural network models. (Wallis) What they have in common is that they consist of nodes (which model neurons) hooked together in some way. Signals then propogate through the network.

I explore a special kind of neural network in which input and output values are distributed over the states of many different “neurons.”

             <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2013-04-01'>April 1</span>Hexadecimal Numeral Names</h3>
It occurred to me the other day, I don't really think of hexadecimal numerals as numbers. I think this is for the same reason I don't think of ID numbers or credit card numbers as numbers. When I read these, I say each digit.

             <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2013-03-31'>March 31</span>An Exploration of Cellular Automata as Dynamical Systems</h3>
In this set of experiments, I explore cellular automata, treated as dynamical systems. The state of the system is a pair of real numbers, with the cells of the cellular automata state corresponding to binary digits of the real numbers. With this mapping, I calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent for each of the 256 elementary cellular automata. This analysis hints that so-called complex, class 4 cellular automata may be distinguished from chaotic, class 3 cellular automata by the largest Lyapunov exponent of the chaotic orbits.

             <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2013-01-20'>January 20</span>Coordinate Systems Matter</h3>
I have discovered more than once in recent free-time projects, that exploiting symmetry can help make code much simpler to write and understand. In fact, it makes some problems feel tractable, when at first they felt as though a complicated "brute force" technique was needed.

In this article, I assume you already have setup all the hardware you need for a Raspberry Pi. We will walk through flashing an OpenELEC XBMC Operating System, configuring XBMC to install video addons and themes, and finally setting up your smart phone as a WiFi remote control.

 In this series, I'll go from start to finish on how to build a home-theater computer with Raspberry Pi and the OpenELEC XBMC Operating System. At the end we'll be able to install XBMC plugins to stream videos, including PBS.

This first article about the hardware needed applies to any Raspberry Pi project, not just a video streaming device.

Lately, I've been playing with Disney PIXEL'D on my iPad, and I've been enjoying using it a lot. While I've been able to make pixel art with other programs on my computer, this is by far the easiest program I've used to make pixel art animations.

    <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2012-08-06'>August 6</span>Packaging matplotlib 1.1.0 for Solaris on SPARC and x86</h3>

This is part 3 of a three-part series on building and packaging matplotlib as a multi-architecture, Solaris IPS package.

For this tutorial, I go through creating a multiple architecture (fat) IPS
package. I assume that the software has already been built and "installed" to a
prototype installation folder on x86 and SPARC machines (I go through this for
matplotlib in part 1). Second, I assume that three IPS servers are running,
which I go through in part 2.

    <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2012-08-06'>August 6</span>Setting up Solaris IPS servers for multiple architecture (fat) packages</h3>

This is part 2 of a three-part series on building and packaging matplotlib as a multi-architecture, Solaris IPS package.

IPS made is a huge step forward compared to SysV packaging. One can still
create and use SysV packages in Solaris 11, but why would you? IPS provides
easy package distribution, upgrades, dependency resolution, and it's still
open source!

This is part 1 of a three-part series on building and packaging matplotlib as a multi-architecture, Solaris IPS package.

At the end of this series, you should be able to install matplotlib as easily as any other Solaris 11 package, on both SPARC and x86 machines.

    <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2011-11-21'>November 21</span>Gravity v0.1 released</h3>
I just put a new version of Gravity (beta) on Kongregate.
Changes :
I added support for multiple masses and also obstacles. Also, I fixed a bug with the physics system. The physics are much more &#8220;realistic&#8221; now. Force actually decreases with distance now!

Last night was the 0h Game Jam, since it was daylight savings. You can play my game at Kongregate.
I decided to make a very simple physics game, where you place a mass in order to make the little &#8220;crates&#8221; hit a target.

    <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2008-09-18'>September 18</span>Python string formatting with the % operator</h3>

<p>So, say you had a console Python application where you are trying to print a table of numbers as your output. You could just&nbsp;say</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>print label, number_1, number_2, number_3</code></pre>

<p>and your "table" would end up looking&nbsp;like:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>The first row 1.001 2.0983 10.12
Another row 11.4 3.144 35.973
Look! Yet another row 12.6 99.72 1.892

        <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2008-06-19'>June 19</span>More fun with Python (the ternary operator)</h3>
    The ternary operator is one of those things that's not really necessary, but can make code quite a bit shorter when put to good use. For those of you who don't know, the ternary operator is a way to evaluate one thing if a condition is true, and a different thing if the condition is false.

        <h3><span class="blog-post-date" title='2008-06-11'>June 11</span>Python List Comprehensions are Easy!</h3>
    I've know about list comprehensions for a while now, but I never really
    bothered learning how to use them. Today, I found that they really aren't
    that bad. In fact, if you already know how to populate a python list inside
    a for loop, you're 95% there already.
